* Architecture
The main goal of this project is to provide a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]] (Scheme) interface to
parse RFC4180 and more general DSV format.  In addition to that the project
provides a console tool named =dsv= which uses Guile-DSV facilities to handle
DSV data in a terminal

** Code Map
*** Overview
All the GNU Guile modules are in =modules= directory.  =dsv= program source
code can be found in =utils= directory.

*** Tests
Tests are in =tests= directory.  They are written using SRFI-61.

When a new functionality is being added a new test case (or several test
cases) should be written for it.
